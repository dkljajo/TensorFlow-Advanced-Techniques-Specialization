** TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization **

In this specialization, you will expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build non-sequential model types. You will learn how to optimize training in different environments and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios, such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. You will also explore generative deep learning, such as Style Transfer, Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs.
